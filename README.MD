### general info
Random guy on reddit made table with like item type each column or something and material each line but it was limited to only centrain items, some time later other reddit guy made script to make every item on even bigger table, so I made way larger mod using own script or "rust program".

### wana try
Theres jar file called "allitems 1.1â€¦" it describes minecraft and forge version you need to install,
but if you can't read it then you need forge 40.1.0 for minecraft 1.18.2.

### wana modify or something
First install newest rust compiler (should be newer than 1.65.0), if you have that then go to "genScript" directory and run command "cargo run --release", it should compile and generate mod.
Then install java 17 if you don't have it already.
Then set up gradle, I don't know what to do so here you are on your own.
Now you can build and try this mod.
Feel free to modify it
